          <h1>songLab :: </h1>
          <h2>A place for musicians around the globe to connect, collaborate, and create something new together.</h2>
          <h3>FEBRUARY - MAY 2016</h3>
          <p>
            songLab is a social web application that allows musicians to connect with other artists and contribute to projects in need of creative collaboration. Users can upload their own projects or browse those that others have posted, sending collaboration requests to the owners of projects they want to work with.

          <h1>CONTEXT :: CHALLENGE</h1>
          <p>
            I came up with the idea for songLab in 2014, after conducting a musical experiment with my friend Amy who lived on the opposite coast -- we each wrote lyrics and exchanged them, challenging the other to write and perform the music before sending them back to each other. The whole process was extremely artistically stimulating; it revealed patterns and differences in musical style and process, and it allowed us to approach the work of another artist from an empathetic standpoint. Plus - it was rad.</p>

            <p>It wasn't long before I thought, why doesn't every musician try this? What if I could find musicians that can add musical elements to my projects that I can't add myself?
            </p>

            <p>And so, songLab was conceived. But it wasn't until a year later when I started working in Web Development that I was able to bring it to life.</p>

            <p>I proposed songLab as a group project idea during my web dev bootcamp at Epicodus. My team consisted of a fellow front-end dev and three PHP devs for back-end development. As beginner to development, I was psyched to find a smart, badass team to help build out my idea.
